  ## Description
  For this challenge I was assigned to create a tech blog from scratch. Users can create an account, log in, create and delete posts, as well as view and comment on other users' posts. The assignment involved creating a database and several routes that dynamically rendered the pages based on user input. I gained a better understanding of how backend code can dynamically create frontend code seen by the user.
